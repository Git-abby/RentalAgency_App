# Vehicle Rental Management System
This project demonstrates a simple vehicle rental management system implemented in C#. It includes classes for vehicles (Car, Truck, Motorcycle), a RentalAgency class to manage the rental operations, and a Program class for demonstration purposes.

> _Features_
Vehicle Classes: Three types of vehicles are supported: Car, Truck, and Motorcycle. Each vehicle has specific properties such as model, brand, year, fuel capacity, seating capacity, fuel type, transmission type, engine power (for motorcycles), and more.
RentalAgency Class: Manages the rental operations including adding vehicles to the fleet, removing vehicles from the fleet, and renting out vehicles to customers. It tracks the total revenue earned by the agency.
Main Program: The Program class demonstrates the functionality of the system. It creates instances of vehicles, displays their details, adds them to the rental agency's fleet, rents out a vehicle, and displays the total revenue earned.
> _How to Use_
